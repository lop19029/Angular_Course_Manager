# CourseManager

On this project I followed a DIO course guidelines to create a course manager interface using Angular and TypeScript.

## Initialize the backend server

Go to `Development\servers\course-manager-server` and run the following commands

`npm install`
`node serve.js`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
